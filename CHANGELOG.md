# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.12.0] - 2021-11-19

### Fixed
- Fix the issue that Amazon Voice Focus does not get applied on new devices mid-meeting.

### Added

- Add `BackgroundBlurCheckbox` component to allow selecting background blur video filter for the `PreviewVideo` component.

### Changed

- The `PreviewVideo` component will listen to the `selectedVideoInputTransform` state, which means it can display regular `Device` video streams, along with `VideoTransformDevice` video streams as well.
- `VideoInputBackgroundBlurControl` component is initialized with the `selectedVideoInputTransformDevice`.

### Removed

## [2.11.1] - 2021-10-25

### Fixed

- Revert back to publishing `audioVideo` update after listing devices. Publishing earlier before listing devices breaks `useAudioInputs`, `useAudioOutputs` and `useVideoInputs` hooks. The reason is device change observers may fail to get added to `audioVideo` based on builders implementation. Hence, falling back to what existed earlier.

### Added

### Changed

### Removed

## [2.11.0] - 2021-10-21

### Fixed

- Fix the issue that `AudioVideoObserver` was not removed as expected in `LocalVideoProvider`.
- Fix `eventDidReceive` observer removal in `MeetingManager`.

### Added

- Add Eslint rules to enforce code style and fix issues.
- Add logs for Amazon Voice Focus components.
- Add FAQ link on audio outputs not available in FireFox and Safari.
- Add `BackgroundBlurProvider` which provides a background blur video transform device.
- Add `VideoInputBackgroundBlurControl` component which includes a checkbox for enabling background blur.
- Add `unsubscribeFromSelectedVideoInputTranformDevice` which subscribes to changes to selected video devices.
- Add `subscribeFromSelectedVideoInputTranformDevice`.
- Add `publishSelectedVideoInputTranformDevice` which publishes a `Device | VideoTransformDevice` depending on what video device was chosen.

### Changed

- Update `useSelectVideoInputDevice` hook documentation and usage example.
- Update package.json to include NPM 8.
- Update `meetingManager.selectVideoInputDevice` to accept `VideoTransformDevice` as a parameter.

### Removed

## [2.10.1] - 2021-10-05

### Fixed

### Added

### Removed

- Revert the commit: Add Amazon Voice Focus to default device to fix the breaking issue [#636](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/issues/636)

## [2.10.0] - 2021-09-29

### Fixed

- Fix the issue that Amazon Voice Focus does not get applied on new devices mid-meeting.
- Fix the issue where we call `meetingManager.leave` an additional time when we call `meetingManager.leave`.
- Remove the observer in `LocalVideoProvider` when it is unmounted to fix memory leak.

### Added

- Add `activeSpeakerPolicy` and `videoUplinkBandwidthPolicy` in `MeetingManagerConfig` to allow builders to pass in custom policies.
- For more flexibility, allow passing `MeetingManagerConfig` to `meetingManager.join` method. Passing the config here would override config passed through `MeetingProvider` props.
- Add more details in the `AudioInputProvider` on storybook.
- Add `MeetingStatus.Left` and set it when explicitly leaving the meeting.
- Publish `MeetingStatus.Failed` when `audioVideoDidStop` gets triggered with one of the Failure types of `MeetingSessionStatus`.
- Add `Terminal Failure` Meeting Status.

### Changed

- Remove the audio video observers in the `audioVideoDidStop()` function instead of `leave()` function in the `MeetingManager`.
- Update `VoiceFocusProvider` and `useVoiceFocus` documentation in the storybook.

### Removed

- Remove setting the `MeetingStatus` to `MeetingStatus.Loading` when we call `meetingManager.leave`.

### Added

Please check [Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript meeting events guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/meetingevents.html) for more information on meeting events.
- Add optional parameter `enableWebAudio: boolean` in the config of meeting manager to decide whether to enable Web Audio in the device controller.

- Add a new provider [VoiceFocusProvider](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/?path=/story/sdk-providers-voicefocusprovider--page) to initialize noise suppression and transform a normal audio input device to an Amazon Voice Focus transform device.
- Add a new UI component [AudioInputVFControl](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/?path=/story/sdk-components-meetingcontrols-audioinputvfcontrol--page) to provide Amazon Voice Focus option to users.
- Add CSS for `disabled` props on `PopOverItem`.
- [Doc] Add documentation for `AudioInputVFControl` component within `MeetingControls` in the story book.
- [Doc] Add documentation for `VoiceFocusProvider` provider in the story book.
- [Doc] Add documentation for [useVoiceFocus](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/?path=/story/sdk-hooks-usevoicefocus--page) hook in the story book.

### Changed

- Change the input type of `useSelectAudioInputDevice` hook from string to `Device` and `AudioTransformDevice`.
- Add `meetingManagerConfig: ManagerConfig` object to `MeetingManager` and use it in `initializeMeetingSession` method. We will use values from `meetingManagerConfig: ManagerConfig` directly instead of class level variables.

### Removed

## [2.8.0] - 2021-07-28

### Fixed

- Exclude the uuid module from the Rollup bundle so that the Chime SDK React Components Library uses the uuid module from the builder's node_modules.
- [Doc] Fix the broken hyperlinks in storybook and slightly improve the storybook.

### Added

- Add optional parameter `deviceLabels: DeviceLabels | DeviceLabelTrigger` in `meetingManager.listAndSelectDevices()` to let builder indicate the type of devices they want to select.
- Add optional parameter `logger` and `videoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy` in `ManagerConfig` to pass in the `Logger` object and `VideoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy` object that you want to be used in the meeting session.
- [Doc] Add several how-to docs in storybook.

### Changed

- The `listAndSelectDevices()` method in `MeetingManager` now selects the devices based on its parameter `deviceLabels` instead of the existence of device label.
- [Doc] Rename the "How-tos" section in storybook to "Quick Starts" as well the file name.

### Removed

- Migrate Meeting Demo app to amazon-chime-sdk repo under aws-sample. The new meeting demo is [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk/tree/main/apps/meeting).

## [2.7.0] - 2021-07-14

### Fixed

### Added

- [Doc] Add explanation for the limitation of the `useDevicePermissionStatus` hook in storybook.
- [Doc] Add how-to doc for view-only mode in storybook.
- Add support to override event reporter for client event ingestion once enabled in the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript. For more information check the [Client Event Ingestion guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/clientevent_ingestion.html) in the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript.
- Add new function `setIsVideoEnabled` in `useLocalVideo` hook.
- [Doc] Add how-to doc for `useMediaStreamMetrics` hook in storybook.

### Changed

- Set the `isVideoEnabled` to `false` when stopping video preview.

### Removed

## [2.6.0] - 2021-06-16

### Fixed

### Added

- Add `sourceId` as an optional parameter in the `toggleContentShare` function to specify which screen to share.
- [Doc] Add a new page, a "How-tos" section in the story book to show use-cases with sample code.
- In `MeetingManager`, add optional parameter `deviceLabels: DeviceLabels | DeviceLabelTrigger` in `join()` method, and add `invokeDeviceProvider(deviceLabels: DeviceLabels)` method to control the device permission request. Builder could pass a `deviceLabels` of type `DeviceLabels` to select the devices from which the browser requests permission when joining the meeting. Builder could also pass a `deviceLabels` of `DeviceLabelTrigger` type, to set their customized `deviceLabelTrigger` which is triggered to get the device info. Builder could call `invokeDeviceProvider(deviceLabels: DeviceLabels)` to trigger the device permission prompts. For example, builder wants to implement a view-only mode and no device permission prompts are triggered during the whole process. Builder could first call `meetingManager.join(DeviceLabels.None)` to join a meeting. Later they can trigger the device permission prompts by calling `meetingManager.invokeDeviceProvider(DeviceLabels.AudioAndVideo)` to get the full access to devices.
