This contains reusable components written with React, TypeScript and styled components to be used to create UIs with Chime SDK JS.

## To genereate dependencies

```
npm install
```

## To run Storybook server locally

```
npm start
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

Once you build, check and resolve any warnings you may get like unresolved dependencies or circular dependencies. Remove these as it will help in bundling the library warning/error free.

## Test

Run all unit test suites.

```
npm run test
```

Run an individual unit test suite.

```
npm run test -- <filepath>
```

Run all unit test suites in watch mode

```
npm run test -- --watch
```

Run all snapshots test suites, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installation is required to run puppeteer in docker container.

```
npm run test:snapshots
```

> Error 1: Service 'chromium' failed to build : toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit

You may need to create a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account and [authenticate pull request from Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/#how-do-i-authenticate-pull-requests). Unauthenticated (anonymous) users will have the limits enforced via IP.

> Error 2: Timeout when you run `npm run test:snapshots`

You have 2 options:

1. Set an environment variable `WAIT_ON_TIMEOUT=600000` (e.g. 10 minutes. By default, it's 5 minutes). It will wait for a longer time while checking for the server to respond.
2. Start storybook server locally by running `npm start`, then run `npm run test:snapshots`.

Run an individual snapshot test suite, make sure that storybook server is running locally before kicking off the test.

```
npm run test:snapshots-path -- <filepath>
```

Run an individual snapshot test suite and override existing snapshot(s).

```
npm run test:snapshots-path -- <filepath> -u
```

A code coverage summary will be printed at the end of each `npm run test` run. Full coverage including coverage for each file is generated in a `lcov-report` html file that can be rendered in the browser. This is generated in a `/coverage` directory on each test run.

# Usage

After publishing your lib (ie `my-react-lib`) you can use it by importing the styles in your App's entry point:

Then you can import and use your components:

```tsx
//
import React from 'react';
import { Example } from 'my-react-lib';

export class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Example />;
  }
}
```
