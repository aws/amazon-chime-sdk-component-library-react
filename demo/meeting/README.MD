This is the SDK react demo app. We are breaking down /browser meeting app to react components here.

To run the react app:
1. Navigate to the `demo/meeting` folder

2. Run `npm install`

3. Start the webpack server: `npm run start:client`

4. In another terminal in the same directory, start the node server: `npm run start:backend`
