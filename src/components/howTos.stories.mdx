# How-to guides

You can refer to the usage and some examples below.

## Enabling content share in Electron applications

In an Electron application, you should create a custom screen picker to retrieve the screen's source ID and pass it to the `toggleContentShare` method from `useContentShareControls` hook to start sharing your screen.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  useContentShareControls,
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => {
  const { toggleContentShare } = useContentShareControls();

  return (
    <MeetingProvider>
      <YourScreenPicker
        onClickShareButton={async (selectedSourceId) => {
          try {
            await toggleContentShare(selectedSourceId);
          } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
          }
        }}
      />
    </MeetingProvider>
  );
};
```

## Implement view-only/observer/spectator experience

To enable a view-only experience, you need to control the device permission prompts for audio and video.

With the release of version 2.6.0, React Component SDK now supports user-defined control for device permission prompts.

In this version, we added optional parameter `deviceLabels: DeviceLabels | DeviceLabelTrigger` in `meetingManager.join()`. You could pass a `deviceLabels` of type `DeviceLabels` to select the devices from which the browser requests permission when joining the meeting. Or you could pass a `deviceLabels` of `DeviceLabelTrigger` type, to set your customized `deviceLabelTrigger` which triggeres the device permission prompts. We also added a new function `invokeDeviceProvider(deviceLabels: DeviceLabels)`. This function can setup the `deviceLabelTrigger` based on the `deviceLabels` passed in, and trigger the `deviceLabelTrigger` to invoke the device permission.

```javascript
enum DeviceLabels {
  None,
  Audio,
  Video,
  AudioAndVideo,
};
```

To implement a view-only experience, you only need to combine these two functions. First pass `DeviceLabels.None` to `meetingManager.join()` to suppress the device permission prompts trigger in `DeviceProvider`. And the functions of `MeetingControls` and `DeviceSelections` are also suppressed. Later when you want to invoke the device permission, call `invokeDeviceProvider()` with parameter `deviceLabels` of the device kind that you want to invoke. Then you can regain the access to the devices.

To suppress device permission:

```jsx
import { useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  const joinMeeting = async () => {
    // Fetch the meeting and attendee data from your server
    const response = await fetch('/my-server');
    const data = await response.json();

    const joinData = {
      meetingInfo: data.Meeting,
      attendeeInfo: data.Attendee,
      deviceLabels: DeviceLabels.None,
    };

    // Use the join API to create a meeting session
    await meetingManager.join(joinData);

    // At this point you can let users setup their devices, or start the session immediately
    await meetingManager.start();
  };

  return <button onClick={joinMeeting}>Join</button>;
};
```

Check the `MeetingForm` in meeting demo for more details.

To invoke device permission:

```javascript
  const handleClick = async () => {
    meetingManager.invokeDeviceProvider(deviceLabels);
  };
```

Check the `DynamicMeetingControl` in meeting demo for more details.

Note: The view-only mode doesn't impact the ability to view content or listen to audio in your meeting experience.
