React components for building realtime meeting applications with Amazon Chime.

- [UI Components](/docs/ui-components-badge--basic-badge)
- [SDK Components](/docs/sdk-components-introduction--page)
- [UI Providers](/docs/ui-providers-notificationprovider--page)
- [SDK Providers](/docs/sdk-providers-introduction--page)

- [Themes](/docs/themes--page)

For the majority of use cases, an Amazon Chime application consists of **a server application** and **a client application**.

* A server application – Manages meeting and attendee resources, and serves those resources to the client application. The server application is created in the AWS account and must have access to the IAM role mentioned previously.

* A client application – Receives meeting and attendee information from the server application, and uses that information to make media.

The server application and client application could be hosted either locally or in the cloud (serverless).

* For hosting locally, see the [client application](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk/tree/main/apps/meeting/src) and [server application](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk/blob/main/apps/meeting/server.js).
* For hosting in the cloud, see the [serverless example](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk/tree/main/apps/meeting/serverless).

## Getting Started

1. Add amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react and the necessary peer dependencies to your project

```sh
npm install --save amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react amazon-chime-sdk-js styled-components styled-system
```

2. Render a `ThemeProvider` and a `MeetingProvider` in the root of your application
   * You can pass a default theme that we provide, or a customized theme that adheres to our theme's structure.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  lightTheme,
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
    <MeetingProvider>
      <MyApp />
    </MeetingProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

3. Join a meeting

To join a meeting, you will need to pass the meeting and attendee data from Chime's [CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) and [CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) APIs. [Read this for more details](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/gettingstarted.html#meeting-service).

```jsx
import { useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  const joinMeeting = async () => {
    // Fetch the meeting and attendee data from your server application
    const response = await fetch('/my-server');
    const data = await response.json();

    const joinData = {
      meetingInfo: data.Meeting,
      attendeeInfo: data.Attendee,
    };

    // Use the join API to create a meeting session using the above data
    await meetingManager.join(joinData);

    // At this point you could let users setup their devices, or by default 
    // the SDK will select the first device in the list for the kind indicated
    // by `deviceLabels` (the default value is DeviceLabels.AudioAndVideo)
    ...

    // Start the session to join the meeting
    await meetingManager.start();
  };

  return <button onClick={joinMeeting}>Join</button>;
};
```

4. Use the SDK components to build out your app

After joining the meeting, you can use the SDK components to render video tiles, meeting controls (such as mute buttons), content share, and more.

For example, the VideoTileGrid will render out all attendee's videos and content share videos of the meeting session into a responsive grid.

```jsx
import { VideoTileGrid } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyMeetingView = () => {
  <VideoTileGrid />;
};
```

5. Optional - adding attendee names to build a roster

Chime does not manage the names of your attendees. If you want video nameplates or a realtime roster, you need to provide a function to `meetingManager.getAttendee` that returns the name of the attendee for a given chime attendee ID and external user ID.

```jsx
import { useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  useEffect(() => {
    meetingManager.getAttendee = async (chimeAttendeeId: string, externalUserId?: string) => {
      const response = await fetch('/my-attendees-endpoint);
      const user = await response.json();

      return {
        name: user.name
      }
    }
  }, [])
}
```

6. _Optional_ - How to enable a meeting to post logs to a URL?

By default, `MeetingManager` provided by `MeetingProvider` uses [`ConsoleLogger`](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/consolelogger.html) to log JS SDK logs.
You can enable posting your logs to a URL by using Amazon Chime JS SDK's [`MeetingSessionPostLogger`](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/meetingsessionpostlogger.html). You can pass `logLevel` and `postLogConfig` as props to the `MeetingProvider`.

Check JS SDK [LogLevel](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/loglevel.html) for more details on log levels.

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
import { LogLevel } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-js';

const postLogConfig: PostLogConfig = {
  name: 'SDK_LOGS',
  batchSize: 85,
  intervalMs: 2000,
  url: url, // JS SDK's `MeetingSessionPostLogger` will POST logs to this URL.
  logLevel: LogLevel.INFO,
};

const meetingConfig = {
  logLevel, // Default is LogLevel.WARN.
  postLogConfig,
};

const Root = () => (
  <MeetingProvider {...meetingConfig}>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

> The component library's [meeting demo](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/blob/master/demo/meeting/src/meetingConfig.ts) showcases above example.
> We post the JS SDK logs to AWS CloudWatch once the demo is deployed. Check the serverless handlers [log](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/blob/master/demo/meeting/serverless/src/handlers.js#L252)
> function and AWS CloudWatch [access policy](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/blob/master/demo/meeting/serverless/template.yaml#L49) in our serverless template for more details.

7. _Optional_ - Opt-out of client event ingestion

The Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript sends meeting events to the Amazon Chime backend to analyze meeting health trends or identify common failures.
This helps to improve your meeting experience. For more information, check the [client event ingestion guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/clientevent_ingestion.html) in the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript guides.

To opt-out of event ingestion from the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript, provide the `NoOpEventReporter` as the `eventReporter` while joining the meeting.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { NoOpEventReporter } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-js';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  useMeetingManager
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();
  const joinMeeting = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/my-meetings-endpoint');
    const data = await response.json();
    const joinData = {
      meetingInfo: data.Meeting,
      attendeeInfo: data.Attendee,
      eventReporter: new NoOpEventReporter();
    };

    try {
      await meetingManager.join(joinData);
    } catch {
      console.error('Something went wrong');
    }
  };

  <button onClick={joinMeeting}>Join Meeting</button>;
};

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

8. _Optional_ - Receive Amazon Chime SDK Meeting Events

You can receive Amazon Chime SDK meeting events in your application by using the `MeetingProvider` and the `useMeetingEvent` hook.
For more information, please check the documentation on the following components:
- [MeetingEventProvider](/story/sdk-providers-meetingeventprovider--page)
- [useMeetingEvent](/story/sdk-hooks-usemeetingevent--page)

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingEvent } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyApp = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MeetingEventReceiver />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MeetingEventReceiver = () => {
  const meetingEvent = useMeetingEvent();
  console.log('Received a meeting event', meetingEvent);
  return null;
};
```

## FAQ

#### How do I build out my own UI using the existing providers?

We provide a set of hooks that you can use that help make building the UI simple.

For example, if you want to build your own mute button, use the `useToggleLocalMute` hook which returns a function to toggle the mute status, and the current mute state.

```jsx
import { useToggleLocalMute } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MyMuteButton = () => {
  const { muted, toggleMute } = useToggleLocalMute();

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleMute}>
      {muted ? 'Unmute myself' : 'Mute myself'}
    </button>
  );
};
```
