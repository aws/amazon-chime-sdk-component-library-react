# PreviewVideo

The `PreviewVideo` component renders a preview of the local user's video. If there is no available video input, the video will be blank. 

A `PreviewVideo` is typically used on a pre-meeting view, or a device settings page. The React SDK depends on the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript, wherein, a single video stream is attached to a video element at a time. Hence, if `PreviewVideo` and `LocalVideo` component both are rendered on the same page and if both are enabled, stopping the video preview in `PreviewVideo` component will result into disconnecting the video stream for `LocalVideo` as well showing a black screen.

## Importing

```javascript
import { PreviewVideo } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  PreviewVideo
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MeetingProvider>
      <PreviewVideo />
    </MeetingProvider>
  );
};
```
