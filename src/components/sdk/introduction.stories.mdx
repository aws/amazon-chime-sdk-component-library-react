# SDK Components

SDK Components provide you the capability to build out a realtime meeting experience easily. They have a dependency on providers being rendered in your application tree, which subsequently have a dependency on the `amazon-chime-sdk-js`.

SDK components are aimed at accelerating your Amazon Chime SDK application development.

## Getting Started

1. Add amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react and the necessary peer dependencies to your project

```sh
npm install --save amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react amazon-chime-sdk-js styled-components styled-system
```

2. Render a `ThemeProvider` and a `MeetingProvider` in the root of your application
   * You can pass a default theme that we provide, or a customized theme that adheres to our theme's structure.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import {
  lightTheme,
  MeetingProvider
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
    <MeetingProvider>
      <MyApp />
    </MeetingProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

3. Use the SDK components to build your app

_Note_ - Some components won't render anything unless there is an active meeting. To join a meeting, you need to use the `join` and `start` APIs that are provided through the [useMeetingManager](/docs/sdk-hooks-usemeetingmanager--page) hook.

```jsx
import {
  VideoTileGrid,
  useMeetingManager
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
import { MeetingSessionConfiguration } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-js';

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  const joinMeeting = async () => {
    // Fetch the meeting and attendee data from your server application
    const response = await fetch('/my-server');
    const data = await response.json();

    // Initalize the `MeetingSessionConfiguration`
    const meetingSessionConfiguration = new MeetingSessionConfiguration(data.Meeting, data.Attendee);

    // Use the join API to create a meeting session using the MeetingSessionConfiguration
    await meetingManager.join(
      meetingSessionConfiguration
    );

    // At this point you could let users setup their devices, or by default 
    // the SDK will select the first device in the list for the s indicated
    // by `deviceLabels` (the default value is DeviceLabels.AudioAndVideo)
    ...

    // Start the session to join the meeting
    await meetingManager.start();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={joinMeeting}>Join</button>
      <VideoTileGrid />
    </>
  );
};
```
