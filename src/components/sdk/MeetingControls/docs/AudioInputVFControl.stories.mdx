# AudioInputVFControl

The `AudioInputVFControl` component renders a `ControlBarButton` with pop over menu options to select through multiple audio input options,
and provides the option of Amazon Voice Focus on the bottom. This component must be used within `VoiceFocusProvider` and `MeetingProvider`.
Make sure you have set `enableWebAudio` as `true` in the meeting config or Amazon Voice Focus feature won't work.

When you click the device button, the local audio input toggles between muted/unmuted state. When you click Amazon Voice Focus button,
Amazon Voice Focus feature toggles between on/off state.

There is a known issue with `440 Hz` and `None` as input audio device. When Amazon Voice Focus is enabled and then you click `440 Hz` or `None`,
the current device will be an Amazon Voice Focus device, but the `440 Hz` or `None` label will not be checked. And if the current device is `440 Hz`,
and then you enable Amazon Voice Focus, the check box infront of `440 Hz` will disappear. After you disable Amazon Voice Focus feature and click
`440 Hz` again, the device label will be checked.

If you want to apply Amazon Voice Focus feature, try this `AudioInputVFControl`. If not, `AudioInputControl` is a better choice.

You can use it in the [ControlBar component](/docs/ui-components-controlbar--control-bar) to build the meeting controls bar.
