# VideoTileGrid

The `VideoTileGrid` component renders all meeting session video tiles in a responsive grid layout. This includes the local tile, remote tiles, and content share tile. By default a user joins without video, so in order to see the VideoTileGrid there must be at least one video tile being shared. To start sharing a video, see the [LocalVideo](?path=/docs/sdk-components-localvideo--page) component.

## Importing

```javascript
import { VideoTileGrid } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  VideoTileGrid,
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <VideoTileGrid />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

## Content Share Behavior

The `VideoTileGrid` component does not support displaying multiple content shares simultaneously:

- It can display only one content share tile at a time in the featured area
- When multiple content shares are active, only the most recently started content share is displayed, and earlier shares are ignored
- The grid size calculation always allocates exactly one tile space for content sharing (when content is present), regardless of how many content share tiles actually exist

This means that even if there are multiple content share tiles available through `useContentShareState()`, the VideoTileGrid will only render one of them.

### Custom Handling of Multiple Content Shares

If you need to support multiple simultaneous content shares, you'll need to implement a custom grid using `useContentShareState` hook and `ContentShare` sdk component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  useContentShareState,
  ContentShare,
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const CustomMultiContentShareGrid = () => {
  // Access all content share tiles
  const { tiles: contentTiles } = useContentShareState();

  return (
    <div className="custom-grid">
      {/* Render each content share tile */}
      {contentTiles.map((tileId) => (
        <ContentShare key={tileId} tileId={tileId} />
      ))}

      {/* Other video tiles */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
