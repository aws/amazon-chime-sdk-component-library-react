# VideoTileGrid

The `VideoTileGrid` component renders all meeting session video tiles in a responsive grid layout. This includes the local tile, remote tiles, and content share tile. By default a user joins without video, so in order to see the VideoTileGrid there must be at least one video tile being shared. To start sharing a video, see the [LocalVideo](?path=/docs/sdk-components-localvideo--page) component.
