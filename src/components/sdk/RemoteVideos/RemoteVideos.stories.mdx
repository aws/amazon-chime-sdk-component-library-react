# RemoteVideos

The `RemoteVideos` component renders videos of all remote attendees with no layout. You will need to provide the styling to handle the layout.

Remote videos are added to the session as attendees start and stop their own video.

## Importing

```javascript
import { RemoteVideos } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  RemoteVideos
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyCustomGrid>
      <RemoteVideos />
    </MyCustomGrid>
  </MeetingProvider>
);
