# Styling Guide

The Amazon Chime SDK React Component Library is comprised of Providers, Hooks, UI Components, and SDK-connected components. 
Each component has some basic styling applied to it, but you can add or override your own styles to the component by using stylesheets,
`styled-components` or other styling frameworks. 

The Amazon Chime SDK React Component Library uses [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/docs) to attach base styles to all of the components. You must install the peer dependency on `styled-components` to use the library. 


# Base Styles
Every component extends either the [BaseSdkProps](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/blob/61464e15175b0f88d141f968790524c5443ea5d1/src/components/sdk/Base/index.tsx) props or [BaseProps](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/blob/61464e15175b0f88d141f968790524c5443ea5d1/src/components/ui/Base/index.ts), which include the `css` and `className` props. 

# Override base styles on a component
There are multiple ways to override the base styling applied on SDK or UI components.

Each UI or SDK component contains one or more DOM elements, and in some cases the DOM elements are nested within each other or dynamically rendered.
In order to select these DOM elements in your stylesheets, you can refer to the individual components' DOM structure. 

## 1. Override styles using the `className` prop

The first method is to use the `className` prop and apply your own classes to the top level DOM element that, in some cases, contain child DOM elements.
This is the preferred method if you are making more than a couple styling changes to the component.

The base styles were designed to hold a low specificity, however due to [this caveat](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#issues-with-specificity) with using `styled-components`, when you select DOM elements in your own stylesheet, you'll need
to use a higher specificity than just one class selector, otherwise the base styles applied by `styled-components` will override your styles.

```jsx
import './style.scss'

<Badge className="floating-badge"/>
```
Then, in your stylesheet, you need to specify the class name:

```scss
// ./style.scss
.floating-badge.floating-badge {
  // override the base styles in Badge component here
}
```
The reason for having to specify the class selector twice is due to [this caveat](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#issues-with-specificity) with `styled-components`. 

## 2. Override styles using `styled-components`

An alternative way you can override base styles is by wrapping an existing component from the `amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react` library inside of another styled component.
This is the preferred approach if you are familiar with `styled-components`.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { Label } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

// Create a new styled component based on one of the components from the component library
let yourStyledLabel = styled(Label)`
  border: solid 1px black;
`
```

## 3. Override styles using the `css` prop
The last method is by providing the `css` prop to any of the components. This prop is meant to be used
for minor changes and is not recommended if making more than a couple styling changes for a component.

```jsx
// CSS prop 
<Badge css="border: solid 1px black"/>
```


#  Unset styling on a component
If you want to unset the base styles for a component, you may do the following.
In some cases, you'll need to use the `*` selector to unstyle components that render nested DOM elements:

## 1. Using `className` prop:
```jsx
import './style.scss';

<Label className="my-label"/>
```
Example of `./style.scss`:
```scss
.my-label.my-label {
  all: unset;
  * {
    all: unset;
  }
}
```
The reason for having to specify the class selector twice is due to [this caveat](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#issues-with-specificity) with `styled-components`. 

## 2. Using `styled-components`
You can attach the `unset` property to an existing component the same way you'd add any other CSS property to an existing component with `styled-components`:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { Label } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

let yourStyledLabel = styled(Label)`
  all: unset;
  * {
    all: unset;
  }
`
```

## 3. Using `css` prop

You can achieve the same with the `css` prop, but this is most likely not the ideal
use of this prop, since this prop is meant for only minor changes to the styling:

```jsx
<Label css="all: unset; * { all: unset }"/>
```
