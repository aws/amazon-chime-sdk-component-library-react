# MeetingProvider

The `MeetingProvider` is the **root provider** for building a realtime meeting application. It is responsible for rendering out a series of providers and providing a `MeetingManager` class that helps integration with the Chime JavaScript SDK. The `MeetingManager` has APIs for joining, starting, and leaving a meeting.

You can access the `MeetingManager` instance with the `useMeetingManager` hook.

## Importing

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

1. Render the `MeetingProvider` near the root of your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

2. Render two `MeetingProvider`s near the root of your application with the same `MeetingManager` instance.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
This approach has limitations. This should be used only in very specific cases where you want to share the meeting manager instance
variable values or you will not use video, roster and audio at both places. Still, the hooks and providers may not work as expected as `MeetingProvider` wraps all the other providers.
The video will not work due to limitations of JS SDK to bind a video stream to a single video tile only. Please check [this](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/issues/492#issuecomment-846317339) issue for more details.

Please make sure your app calls `meetingManager.join(meetingSessionConfiguration)` only once. The `join` method needs `MeetingSessionConfiguration` as a required parameter. `MeetingSessionConfiguration` should be created with the same `attendeeInfo`.
Otherwise, the previous attendee who joined the meeting will leave the meeting with [AudioJoinedFromAnotherDevice](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/meetingsessionstatuscode.html#audiojoinedfromanotherdevice).

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => {
  const meetingManager = new MeetingManager({ logLevel: LogLevel.INFO });

  return (
    <MeetingProvider meetingManager={meetingManager}>
      <MyApp1 />
    <MeetingProvider/>

    <MeetingProvider meetingManager={meetingManager}>
      <MyApp2 />
    <MeetingProvider/>
  );
}
```

## Props

<Props of={MeetingProvider} />

### Prop values

#### onDeviceReplacement

When a selected device is disconnected, or when the Operating System (OS) default device is selected and is changed by the OS (e.g., if a Bluetooth headset is disconnected),
the `AudioInputProvider` encapsulated by `DevicesProvider` is forced to automatically select a new audio input. This behaves as expected when the selected device is an ordinary device provided by the browser.
However, when your application is using a transform device like Amazon Voice Focus, the `AudioInputProvider` needs a way to transform the newly selected device to avoid reverting to a non-transform device.
This is accomplished by exposing a `onDeviceReplacement` prop on `MeetingProvider` and `DevicesProvider`, allowing your application to customize the behavior of this device reselection step.
Provide a function that accepts a `Device` as input and returns a `Device` or `AudioTransformDevice` of your choice.

#### meetingManager

There may be use cases to re-use the same `MeetingManager` instance across multiple different `MeetingProvider`s.
Hence, you can create a new `MeetingManager` instance and then pass it as a prop to your `MeetingProvider`s. If not passed,
a new `MeetingManager` instance will be created internally with each `MeetingProvider` when rendered; and,
you will get the `MeetingManager` instance associated with that particular `MeetingProvider` when `useMeetingManager` hook is called.

This approach has limitations. This should be used only in very specific cases where you want to share the meeting manager instance
variable values and you will not use video, roster and audio at both places. Still, the hooks and providers may not work as expected as `MeetingProvider` wraps all the other providers.
The video will not work due to limitations of JS SDK to bind a video stream to a single video tile only. Please check [this](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/issues/492#issuecomment-846317339) issue for more details.

Please make sure your app calls `meetingManager.join()` only once with the same `attendeeInfo`.
Otherwise, the previous attendee who joined the meeting will leave the meeting with [AudioJoinedFromAnotherDevice](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/meetingsessionstatuscode.html#audiojoinedfromanotherdevice).
