# MeetingProvider

The **root provider** for building a realtime meeting application. It is responsible for rendering out a series of providers and providing a `MeetingManager` class that helps integrate with the Chime JavaScript SDK. The `MeetingManager` has APIs for joining, starting, and leaving a meeting.

You can access the `MeetingManager` instance with the `useMeetingManager` hook.

## Importing

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

Render the MeetingProvider near the root of your application. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```
