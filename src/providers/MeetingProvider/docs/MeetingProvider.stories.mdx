# MeetingProvider

The **root provider** for building a realtime meeting application. It is responsible for rendering out a series of providers and providing a `MeetingManager` class that helps integrate with the Chime JavaScript SDK.

## Usage

@@ THIS IS A TODO SECTION @@

MeetingProvider requires you to configure how to fetch the meeting data and attendee data. 

@@ END TODO SECTION @@

The MeetingProvider should be placed near or at the root of your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp>
      <MyChild />
    </MyApp>
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

Once you have placed the MeetingProvider, you can use any of our hooks or components within your application.
