# MeetingProvider

The `MeetingProvider` is the **root provider** for building a realtime meeting application. It is responsible for rendering out a series of providers and providing a `MeetingManager` class that helps integration with the Chime JavaScript SDK. The `MeetingManager` has APIs for joining, starting, and leaving a meeting.

You can access the `MeetingManager` instance with the `useMeetingManager` hook.

## Importing

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

1. Render the `MeetingProvider` near the root of your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

2. Render two `MeetingProvider`s near the root of your application with the same `MeetingManager` instance.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
This approach has limitations. This should be used only in very specific cases where you want to share the meeting manager instance
variable values or you will not use video, roster and audio at both places. Still, the hooks and providers may not work as expected as `MeetingProvider` wraps all the other providers.
The video will not work due to limitations of JS SDK to bind a video stream to a single video tile only. Please check [this](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/issues/492#issuecomment-846317339) issue for more details.

Please make sure your app calls `meetingManager.join()` only once with the same `attendeeInfo`.
Otherwise,  the previous attendee who joined the meeting will leave the meeting with [AudioJoinedFromAnotherDevice](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/meetingsessionstatuscode.html#audiojoinedfromanotherdevice).

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => {
  const meetingManager = new MeetingManager({ logLevel: LogLevel.INFO });
  
  return (
    <MeetingProvider meetingManager={meetingManager}>
      <MyApp1 />
    <MeetingProvider/>

    <MeetingProvider meetingManager={meetingManager}>
      <MyApp2 />
    <MeetingProvider/>
  ); 
}
```

## Props

<Props of={MeetingProvider} />

### Prop values

#### logLevel

The level of logging you want with your meeting session. It is defined by the [LogLevel](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/loglevel.html) enum in `amazon-chime-sdk-js`.

```javascript
enum LogLevel {
  DEBUG,
  INFO,
  WARN,
  ERROR,
  OFF
}
```

#### postLogConfig

Configuration for setting up a [MeetingSessionPOSTLogger](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/classes/meetingsessionpostlogger.html).

```javascript
interface PostLogConfig = {
  name: string;
  batchSize: number;
  intervalMs: number;
  url: string;
  logLevel: LogLevel
}
```

#### simulcastEnabled

To enable simulcast for the meeting pass the `simulcastEnabled` prop with value set to `true`. By default, it is `false`.
For more information on Simulcast, check Amazon Chime JS SDK [simulcast guide](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js/blob/master/guides/05_Simulcast.md).

#### enableWebAudio
If you want to enable Amazon Voice Focus feature, you should enable Web Audio for the meeting and pass the `enableWebAudio` prop with value set to `true`. By default, it is `false`.

#### logger

The `Logger` object that you want to be used in the meeting session.
If you pass in a `Logger` object using this parameter, the `MeetingManager` will use this object instead of creating a logger based on `logLevel` and `postLogConfig` to initialize the meeting session.

#### videoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy

The `VideoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy` object that you want to be used in the meeting session.
For more information on `VideoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy`, check Amazon Chime JS SDK [priority downlink policy guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/prioritybased_downlink_policy.html).

For example, to use the `VideoPriorityBasedPolicy` in the meeting:

```jsx
import {
  LogLevel,
  ConsoleLogger,
  VideoPriorityBasedPolicy,
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-js';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => {
  const logger = new ConsoleLogger('SDK', LogLevel.INFO);
  const videoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy = new VideoPriorityBasedPolicy(logger);

  const meetingConfig = {
    logger,
    videoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy,
  };

  return (
    <MeetingProvider {...meetingConfig}>
      <MyApp />
    </MeetingProvider>
  );
};
```

#### meetingManager

There may be use cases to re-use the same `MeetingManager` instance across multiple different `MeetingProvider`s.
Hence, you can create a new `MeetingManager` instance and then pass it as a prop to your `MeetingProvider`s. If not passed,
a new `MeetingManager` instance will be created internally with each `MeetingProvider` when rendered; and, 
you will get the `MeetingManager` instance associated with that particular `MeetingProvider` when `useMeetingManager` hook is called.

This approach has limitations. This should be used only in very specific cases where you want to share the meeting manager instance
variable values and you will not use video, roster and audio at both places. Still, the hooks and providers may not work as expected as `MeetingProvider` wraps all the other providers.
The video will not work due to limitations of JS SDK to bind a video stream to a single video tile only. Please check [this](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/issues/492#issuecomment-846317339) issue for more details.

Please make sure your app calls `meetingManager.join()` only once with the same `attendeeInfo`.
Otherwise, the previous attendee who joined the meeting will leave the meeting with [AudioJoinedFromAnotherDevice](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/meetingsessionstatuscode.html#audiojoinedfromanotherdevice).
