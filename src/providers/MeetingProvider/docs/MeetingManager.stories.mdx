# MeetingManager

The `MeetingManager` is a class that helps integration with the SDK. It is tied to the `MeetingProvider` and is primarily responsible for joining, starting, and leaving your meeting.

You can access the `MeetingManager` instance with the `useMeetingManager` hook.

## Usage

`MeetingProvider` must be rendered somewhere higher in the tree.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  ...
}
```

## Constructor

Accepts `logLevel` provided by `MeetingProvider` to initialize meeting session log level. Check [MeetingProvider](/?path=/docs/sdk-providers-meetingprovider--page) documentation for more details on `logLevel`.

## Interface

### `meetingManager.join`

Creates a meeting session using the meeting and attendee data passed. It will attempt to select default devices for the user.

```javascript
(data: MeetingJoinData) => Promise<void>

interface MeetingJoinData {
  // The response of calling chime:CreateMeeting from your server
  meetingInfo: any;

  // The response of calling chime:CreateAttendee from your server
  attendeeInfo: any;
}
```

### `meetingManager.start`

Starts the meeting session so that attendees can receive audio and video from the meeting. This must be called after calling `join`.

```javascript
() => Promise<void>
```

### `meetingManager.leave`

Stops the meeting session and performs cleanup. This should be called anytime a user needs to leave a meeting.

```javascript
() => Promise<void>
```

### `meetingManager.getAttendee`

This method is expected to be supplied by the developer. You may call this function with the Chime user ID and external user ID anytime an attendee joins the meeting, and expect to be resolved with an object that has a `name` property that will be used for video nameplates and roster state.

For example - you may want to fetch the attendee from the database, or get the name from some local application state. This is up to the developer.

```javascript
(
  chimeAttendeeId: string,
  externalUserId?: string
) => Promise<AttendeeResponse>

interface AttendeeResponse {
  name?: string;
}
```

#### Example

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  <MeetingProvider/>
);

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  useEffect(() => {
    meetingManager.getAttendee = async (chimeAttendeeId: string, externalUserId?: string) => {
      const response = await fetch('/my-attendees-endpoint);
      const user = await response.json();

      return {
        name: user.name
      }
    }
  }, [])
}
```
