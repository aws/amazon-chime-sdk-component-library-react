# MeetingManager

The `MeetingManager` is a class that helps integration with the SDK. It is tied to the `MeetingProvider` and is primarily responsible for joining, starting, and leaving your meeting.

You can pass in the same `MeetingManager` instance to multiple different `MeetingProvider`s through props. This will override new `MeetingManager` instance creation inside
the `MeetingProvider`. This is to support very specific cases where you may have different React trees within you applications. For example, you are migrating
from an Angular application to a React application.


You can access the `MeetingManager` instance with the `useMeetingManager` hook.

## Usage

`MeetingProvider` must be rendered somewhere higher in the tree.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  ...
}
```

## Constructor

Accepts a config object of `logLevel`, `postLogConfig`, `simulcastEnabled`, `enableWebAudio`, `logger` and `videoDownlinkBandwidthPolicy` that will be used when initializing a meeting session. See [MeetingProvider](/docs/sdk-providers-meetingprovider--page) documentation for more details.

## Interface

### `meetingManager.join`

Creates a meeting session using the meeting and attendee data passed. It will attempt to select default devices for the user.

```typescript
import { EventReporter } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-js';

(data: MeetingJoinData) => Promise<void>

interface MeetingJoinData {
  // The response of calling chime:CreateMeeting from your server.
  meetingInfo: any;

  // The response of calling chime:CreateAttendee from your server.
  attendeeInfo: any;

  // The kind of device for which the browser requests permission.
  // Or override the default device label trigger in the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript.
  deviceLabels?: DeviceLabels | DeviceLabelTrigger;

  // Override the default event reporter in the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript.
  eventReporter: EventReporter;
}
```

### `meetingManager.start`

Starts the meeting session so that attendees can receive audio and video from the meeting. This must be called after calling `join`.

```javascript
() => Promise<void>
```

### `meetingManager.leave`

Stops the meeting session and performs cleanup. This should be called anytime a user needs to leave a meeting.

```javascript
() => Promise<void>
```

### `meetingManager.getAttendee`

This method is expected to be supplied by the developer. You may call this function with the Chime user ID and external user ID anytime an attendee joins the meeting, and expect to be resolved with an object that has a `name` property that will be used for video nameplates and roster state. We also add support for optional keys, so you can also pass any other data except `name`.

For example - you may want to fetch the attendee from the database, or get the name from some local application state. This is up to the developer.

```javascript
(
  chimeAttendeeId: string,
  externalUserId?: string
) => Promise<AttendeeResponse>

interface AttendeeResponse {
  name?: string;
  [attribute: string]: any;
}
```

#### Example

1. `MeetingManager` instance is created internally in the `MeetingProvider` and can be retrived using `useMeetingManager` hook.
```jsx
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  <MeetingProvider/>
);

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  useEffect(() => {
    meetingManager.getAttendee = async (chimeAttendeeId: string, externalUserId?: string) => {
      const response = await fetch('/my-attendees-endpoint);
      const user = await response.json();

      return {
        name: user.name
      }
    }
  }, [])
}
```

2. Share the same `MeetingManager` instance with multiple different `MeetingProvider`s.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
This approach has limitations. This should be used only in very specific cases where you want to share the meeting manager instance
variable values and you will not use video, roster and audio at both places. Still, the hooks and providers may not work as expected as `MeetingProvider` wraps all the other providers.
The video will not work at both places due to limitations of JS SDK to bind a video stream to a single video tile only. Please check [this](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/issues/492#issuecomment-846317339) issue for more details.

Please make sure your app calls `meetingManager.join()` only once with the same `attendeeInfo`.
Otherwise,  the previous attendee who joined the meeting will leave the meeting with [AudioJoinedFromAnotherDevice](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/enums/meetingsessionstatuscode.html#audiojoinedfromanotherdevice).

You can create a new `MeetingManager` instance and then pass it as a prop to your `MeetingProvider`s. If not passed,
a new `MeetingManager` instance will be created internally with each `MeetingProvider` when rendered; and, 
you will get the `MeetingManager` instance associated with that particular `MeetingProvider` when `useMeetingManager` hook is called.

```jsx
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const Root = () => {
  const meetingManager = new MeetingManager({ logLevel: LogLevel.INFO });
  
  return (
    <MeetingProvider meetingManager={meetingManager}>
      <MyApp1 />
    <MeetingProvider/>

    <MeetingProvider meetingManager={meetingManager}>
      <MyApp2 />
    <MeetingProvider/>
  ); 
}
```

3. Opt-out of client event ingestion.

The Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript sends meeting events to the Amazon Chime backend to analyze meeting health trends or identify common failures.
This helps to improve your meeting experience. For more information, check the [client event ingestion guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/clientevent_ingestion.html) in the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript guides.

To opt-out of event ingestion from the Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript, provide the `NoOpEventReporter` as the `eventReporter` while joining the meeting.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { NoOpEventReporter } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-js';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const MeetingForm = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();
  const handleJoinMeeting = async (event) => {
    await meetingManager.join({
      meetingInfo,
      attendeeInfo,
      eventReporter: new NoOpEventReporter()
    });
  }
  return (
    <PrimaryButton label="Continue" onClick={handleJoinMeeting} />
  )
}

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MeetingForm />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```
