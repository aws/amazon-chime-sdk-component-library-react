# MeetingEventProvider

The `MeetingEventProvider` is responsible to provide the latest meeting event posted by Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript.
Please note that, this provides only the latest meeting event posted, hence olders event will be overriden as new event is received.
For more information on meeting events, please check [Amazon Chime SDK meeting events guide](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/meetingevents.html).

You can access the provided event data with [useMeetingEventData](/story/sdk-hooks-usemeetingeventdata--page) hook.

## Importing

```jsx
import { MeetingEventProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

If you are using `MeetingProvider`, the `MeetingEventProvider` is rendered by default and you don't need to do anything else.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingEventData } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MeetingEventReceiver />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MeetingEventReceiver = () => {
  const eventData = useMeetingEventData();
  console.log('Event Data', eventData);
  return null;
}
```
