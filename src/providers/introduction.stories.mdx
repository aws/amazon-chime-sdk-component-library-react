<Meta title="SDK Providers/Introduction" />

# Introduction

Providers are responsible for maintaining state and functionality related to the Amazon Chime JS SDK.

While this section includes documentation on individual providers, **you will likely only ever need to work with the `MeetingProvider`**. The `MeetingProvider` is the root provider, and renders all other providers so that you can quickly build out a realtime meeting application.

## Getting Started with MeetingProvider

To build a realtime meeting applications with the `MeetingProvider`, you can follow these steps

1. Render the MeetingProvider near the root of your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);
```

2. _Optional_ - Configure how to fetch attendees as they join the meeting

If you want nameplates on your videos or want to build a realtime roster of attendees, you will need to assign a `meetingManager.getAttendee` function. You can pass the chime attendee ID and external user ID (if present) to this function as attendees join the meeting. It is expected to return a promise that resolves with the attendee's name.

You can access the `MeetingManager` class instance with the `useMeetingManager` hook.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MeetingProvider, useMeetingManager } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  useEffect(() => {
    meetingManager.getAttendee = async (chimeAttendeeId: string, externalUserId?: string) => {
      const response = await fetch('/my-attendees-endpoint);
      const user = await res.json();

      return {
        name: user.name
      }
    }
  }, [])
}
```

3. Join a meeting

To join a meeting, you will need to pass the meeting and attendee data from Chime's [CreateAttendee](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAttendee.html) and [CreateMeeting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMeeting.html) APIs. [Read this for more details](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-js/modules/gettingstarted.html#meeting-service).

Once you have your meeting and attendee data, you can call `meetingManager.join` to join the meeting.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  useMeetingManager
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MyApp = () => {
  const meetingManager = useMeetingManager();

  const joinMeeting = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/my-meetings-endpoint');
    const data = await response.json();

    const joinData = {
      meetingInfo: data.Meeting,
      attendeeInfo: data.Attendee
    };

    try {
      await meetingManager.join(joinData);
    } catch {
      console.error('Something went wrong');
    }
  };

  <button onClick={joinMeeting}>Join Meeting</button>;
};
```

4. Start the meeting session

After joining a meeting, you can begin the meeting sesion by calling `meetingManager.start`. You may want to allow users to configure their selected input/output devices prior to calling `start`.

5. Done!

The attendee should be in the meeting, and able to receive audio/video. Check out the `SDK components` documentation section for components that you can drop in, or the `SDK hooks` for building out your own UI.
