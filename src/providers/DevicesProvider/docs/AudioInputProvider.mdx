# AudioInputProvider

The `AudioInputProvider` provides a list of the user's available audio input devices and the currently selected audio input device.

## State

```ts
{
  // A list of the user's available audio input devices
  devices: [{
    deviceId: string;
    label: string;
  }],

  // The currently selected audio input device
  selectedDevice: AudioInputDevice | undefined,
}

```

NOTE:

1. In Chrome, there is a "default" device which can used as the current audio input device. When a new device is added during the
meeting, the new device will become the current audio input device also the new "default" device. If you want to get this device change,
it would be better to use `devices`. When a new "default" device is added, the `devices` list will have changed. We suggest you to
watch for changes to `devices[0]` - this will indicate when the "default" device has changed. `selectedDevice` will not be updated when
switching to a new audio device since it stands for the deviceId, and the value of deviceId remains the same, still being `default`.
The deviceId that was previously in use was `default`. When you switch to a new device, that device becomes "default" device. Since the old
deviceId was `default` and the new deviceId is still `default`, so `selectedDevice` does not change. But actually they correspond to different physical devices.

2. If you are joining a meeting with `DeviceLabels.None` or overriding the default device label trigger function (Check "Get Device Permissions From the Browser" under the [quickstarts](https://aws.github.io/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react/?path=/story/quick-starts--page) for more information),
then, the `AudioInputProvider` will not automatically select an audio input device when audio input device list changes. To keep the auto-selection of the audio input device on audio input changes,
you have to either provide `DeviceLabels.Audio` or `DeviceLabels.AudioVideo` to `meetingManager.join` API or `meetingManager.invokeDeviceProvider` API.

You can access the state by using the [useAudioInputs](/docs/sdk-hooks-useaudioinputs--page) hook.

## Importing

```javascript
import { AudioInputProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

If you are using `MeetingProvider`, `AudioInputProvider` is rendered by default.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  useAudioInputs,
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyChild />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MyChild = () => {
  const { devices, selectedDevice } = useAudioInputs();
  const items = devices.map((device) => (
    <li key={device.deviceId}>{device.label}</li>
  ));

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Selected Audio Input Device: {JSON.stringify(selectedDevice)}</p>
      <p>Devices</p>
      <ul>{items}</ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```
