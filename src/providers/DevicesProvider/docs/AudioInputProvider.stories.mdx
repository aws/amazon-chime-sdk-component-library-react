# AudioInputProvider

The `AudioInputProvider` provides a list of the user's available `audio-input` devices, the currently selected device, and the error if device selection fails.

## State

```javascript
{
  devices: [{
    deviceId: string;
    label: string;
  }],

  // The device ID of the currently selected device
  selectedDevice: string | null

  // The error if device selection fails
  selectDeviceError?: Error | null
}

```

NOTE: In Chrome, there is a "default" device which can used as the current audio input device. When a new device is added during the 
meeting, the new device will become the current audio input device also the new "default" device. If you want to get this device change, 
it would be better to use `devices`. When a new "default" device is added, the `devices` list will have changed. We suggest you to 
watch for changes to `devices[0]` - this will indicate when the "default" device has changed. `selectedDevice` will not be updated when 
switching to a new audio device since it stands for the deviceId, and the value of deviceId remains the same, still being `default`. 
The deviceId that was previously in use was `default`. When you switch to a new device, that device becomes "default" device. Since the old 
deviceId was `default` and the new deviceId is still `default`, so `selectedDevice` does not change. But actually they correspond to different physical devices. 

You can access the state by using the [useAudioInputs](/docs/sdk-hooks-useaudioinputs--page) hook.

## Importing

```javascript
import { AudioInputProvider } from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';
```

## Usage

If you are using `MeetingProvider`, `AudioInputProvider` is rendered by default.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  MeetingProvider,
  useAudioInputs
} from 'amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react';

const App = () => (
  <MeetingProvider>
    <MyChild />
  </MeetingProvider>
);

const MyChild = () => {
  const { devices, selectedDevice, selectDeviceError } = useAudioInputs();
  const items = devices.map(device => (
    <li key={device.deviceId}>{device.label}</li>
  ));

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Selected DeviceId: {selectedDevice}</p>
      <p>Devices</p>
      <ul>{items}</ul>
      {selectDeviceError && (<p>{selectDeviceError.message}</p>)}
    </div>
  );
};
```
